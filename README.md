# Census divisions map

Geojson map of 2011 Canadian census divisions started with the cartographic Shapefile here: http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/bound-limit-2011-eng.cfm

The polygons were then simplified and additional census data was added in QGIS before exporting as Geojson for use with d3.
